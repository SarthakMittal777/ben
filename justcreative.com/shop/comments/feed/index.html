					<description><![CDATA[This template was very clear and easy to use. Everything in the file was editable and set up in a way that saved me so much time from needing to create my own framework process file.  I was able to easily utilize Jacob&#039;s Brand Discovery Strategy Framework and Training to walk a client through their own brand discovery process.

					<description><![CDATA[Snagged it yesterday. Great stuff. Even without watching the video that comes with, it&#039;s worth the $29. Being able to see how you run your workshops and comparing it to mine is going to help me serve my clients better. For $29?? There&#039;s literally no reason not to. Thanks!]]></description>
